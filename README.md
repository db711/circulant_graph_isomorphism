# circulant_graph_isomorphism
Contains an algorithm to test whether two circulant graphs are isomorphic in polynomial time.
This algorithm was first presented by M. Muzychuk in https://doi.org/10.1112/S0024611503014412 and (to my knowledge anyway) first implemented by me as part of my Bachelor Thesis "Das Isomorphieproblem für zirkuläre Graphen" (written in German) in 2019.
Additionally we supply a list of all circulant graphs for n = 1, 2, ..., 20 vertices, which was computed using this algorithm.
